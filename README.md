## Introduction
This repository comprises R codes and data for the research project: 'Shifting spring ephemeral pollination windows under climate change - a three body problem' published on *New Phytologist* in 2025.

## R code
The R script include LME modeling for phenological shifts over years among spring beauty flowering, spring beauty mining bee occurrence and canopy closure date across Level III ecoregions, phenological sensitivity to temperature and precipitation across Level III ecoregions, and predictions of current 30-y average and future time periods with two different climate change scenarios. Spring beauty flower pollination window length and mean date from model predictions are calculated to determine how future predicted phenological shifts of three guilds affect the pollination windows across ecoregions. 

## Dataset
The phenology and associated data for modeling are available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6787563).
